Hi Dominik! 

If you venture outside right now in Los Angeles, you'll find the temperature to be 10.0°C, but it will feel more like 8.6°C. The relative humidity is 74%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Your home is where your thoughts find peace." - Zen Proverb
2. "There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge..." - Napoleon Hill
3. "Being In The Present Means Tuning Out Distractions And Paying Attention To What Is Important, Now." - Spencer Johnson

This is what Spock might say to you today:

Dominik, as you navigate the stars of your own
path, remember that true direction is found where
your mind is at peace. Limitations are only as
real as you allow them to be. Focus on the
present, much like a Vulcan would embrace logic to
awaken new possibilities. As Captain might say, do
not simply seek warp speed; rather, ensure your
course is true and your heart beats as steadily as
the thrum of the Enterprise's engines. Live long
and prosper on your journey, my friend.

Have a fantastic journey!
