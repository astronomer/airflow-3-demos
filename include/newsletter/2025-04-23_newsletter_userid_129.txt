Hi Jan! 

If you venture outside right now in Bern, you'll find the temperature to be 15.2°C, but it will feel more like 13.6°C. The relative humidity is 64%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time.  " - Zig Ziglar
2. "Troubles are often the tools by which God fashions us for better things." - Henry Ward Beecher
3. "The degree of responsibility you take for your life determines how much change you can create in it." - Celestine Chua

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Jan, remember when we charted the Delta Quadrant,
facing the unknown with nothing but star charts
and hope? Failure to move forward could leave us
in stasis. Troubles aren't just obstacles; like
Borg assimilation, they reshape us, mold us into
something stronger. Let your quest for truth guide
you. By taking responsibility for your path,
you'll set a course for transformation that even Q
would envy. Engage with your journey, and you'll
find your way home to the truth you seek.

Have a fantastic journey!
