Hi Dominik! 

If you venture outside right now in Los Angeles, you'll find the temperature to be 10.9°C, but it will feel more like 9.6°C. The relative humidity is 77%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education." - Zhuangzi
2. "When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it." - Dalai Lama
3. "When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal; you do not change your decision to get there." - Zig Ziglar

This is what Spock might say to you today:

Dominik, as you continue to navigate the galaxy in
search of your path, remember that true growth
transcends simple reactions. If an error occurs,
correct it with precision, quick and decisive. 
Should cosmic hurdles detour you, adjust your 
course like the Enterprise surmounting a temporal 
anomaly. Your resolve to reach your destination 
must be steadfast, like a captain navigating 
through space, guided by logic and courage.

Have a fantastic journey!
