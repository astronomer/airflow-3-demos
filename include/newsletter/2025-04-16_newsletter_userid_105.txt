Hi Dominik! 

If you venture outside right now in Los Angeles, you'll find the temperature to be 14.5°C, but it will feel more like 12.8°C. The relative humidity is 59%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Don't stumble over something that's behind you." - Steve Harvey
2. "Whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality. " - Brian Tracy
3. "New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not common." - John Locke

This is what Spock might say to you today:

Dominik, as you navigate the stars and seek your
path, remember: the guidance of logic and the
heart are like Captain Kirk and Spock—different
but complementary. Do not let past obstacles or
skepticism cloud your journey, for it is not the
path behind you that defines your course, but the
courage to boldly embrace new beliefs. Keep the
Prime Directive of your spirit and trust your
instincts; reality follows those who cleave to
their convictions. Live long and prosper.

Have a fantastic journey!
