Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time.  " - Zig Ziglar
2. "Troubles are often the tools by which God fashions us for better things." - Henry Ward Beecher
3. "The degree of responsibility you take for your life determines how much change you can create in it." - Celestine Chua

Have a fantastic journey!
