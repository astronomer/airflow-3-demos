Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 17.5°C, but it will feel more like 16.0°C. The relative humidity is 70%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time.  " - Zig Ziglar
2. "Troubles are often the tools by which God fashions us for better things." - Henry Ward Beecher
3. "The degree of responsibility you take for your life determines how much change you can create in it." - Celestine Chua

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, remember that helping people find their
wings is your guiding star. Life's challenges are
not mere obstacles but tools that refine your
strength, much like the tests of the Delta
Quadrant. Aim boldly, set your trajectory like the
helm on course for uncharted space. Your ability
to embrace responsibility determines the new
worlds you can explore and the change you can
create. Keep a steady hand on the helm, and your
spirit will soar. As a certain Captain might say,
"Warp speed ahead!"

Have a fantastic journey!
