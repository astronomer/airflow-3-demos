Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 19.2°C, but it will feel more like 14.7°C. The relative humidity is 65%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Don't stumble over something that's behind you." - Steve Harvey
2. "Whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality. " - Brian Tracy
3. "New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not common." - John Locke

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, remember that even when the stars seem
distant, your path is still illuminated by your
unique light. Keep your focus forward—don't
stumble over what's in your past. While others
might not yet see the horizon you're envisioning,
hold fast to your belief. It's the faith in your
journey, like the untiring spirit of a certain
Captain, that will guide you to the Delta Quadrant
of your own dreams. Help others find their wings,
and in doing so, discover your own.

Have a fantastic journey!
