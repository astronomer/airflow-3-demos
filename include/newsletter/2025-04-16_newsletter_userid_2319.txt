Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 21.0°C, but it will feel more like 16.7°C. The relative humidity is 55%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education." - Zhuangzi
2. "When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it." - Dalai Lama
3. "When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal; you do not change your decision to get there." - Zig Ziglar


-----------
This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, in helping others find their wings,
remember that true wisdom lies not in mere rewards
or punishments, but in igniting curiosity and
growth. Mistakes are just navigational
adjustments; set your course and don't hesitate to
correct your path. When challenges arise, channel
your inner Starfleet officer—adjust your
trajectory if needed, but never abandon your
mission. Engage fully, for your journey will forge
the path to stars unknown.

Have a fantastic journey!
