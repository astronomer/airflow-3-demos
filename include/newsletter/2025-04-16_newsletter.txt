Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education." - Zhuangzi
2. "When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it." - Dalai Lama
3. "When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal; you do not change your decision to get there." - Zig Ziglar

Have a fantastic journey!
