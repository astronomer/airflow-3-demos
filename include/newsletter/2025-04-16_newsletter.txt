Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Don't stumble over something that's behind you." - Steve Harvey
2. "Whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality. " - Brian Tracy
3. "New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not common." - John Locke

Have a fantastic journey!
