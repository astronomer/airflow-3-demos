Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Your home is where your thoughts find peace." - Zen Proverb
2. "There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge..." - Napoleon Hill
3. "Being In The Present Means Tuning Out Distractions And Paying Attention To What Is Important, Now." - Spencer Johnson

Have a fantastic journey!
