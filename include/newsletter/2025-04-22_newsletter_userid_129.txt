Hi Jan! 

If you venture outside right now in Bern, you'll find the temperature to be 11.9°C, but it will feel more like 10.6°C. The relative humidity is 66%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Life is like a beautiful melody, only the lyrics are messed up." - Hans Christian Andersen
2. "What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each other?" - T.S. Eliot
3. "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou

This is what Jadzia might say to you today:

Jan, life can sometimes seem like a symphony where
the rhythms harmonize but the words get tangled.
Remember, we don’t just exist to navigate our own
paths, but to synchronize with others and make the
journey smoother together. Like the symbiont's
wisdom passed down through hosts, it’s how you
make others feel that truly resonates through
time. Embrace the truth you seek; like the trill
symbiosis, it will guide you toward courage and
unity. You've got this, my dear friend.

Have a fantastic journey!
