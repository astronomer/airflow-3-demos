Hi Dominik! 

If you venture outside right now in Los Angeles, you'll find the temperature to be 19.7°C, but it will feel more like 19.0°C. The relative humidity is 56%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Life is like a beautiful melody, only the lyrics are messed up." - Hans Christian Andersen
2. "What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each other?" - T.S. Eliot
3. "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou

This is what Spock might say to you today:

Dominik, navigating life can feel like a melody
with scrambled lyrics, yet amidst the cacophony,
remember the melody of what truly matters: easing
the burdens of others. Like the logic guiding a
Vulcan, the moments that endure are not in words
spoken or deeds done, but in emotions we evoke.
Continue to boldly go where you impact lives,
leaving a legacy as profound as the first warp-
speed voyage. Live long, and encourage.

Have a fantastic journey!
