Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 15.9°C, but it will feel more like 14.7°C. The relative humidity is 88%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Life is like a beautiful melody, only the lyrics are messed up." - Hans Christian Andersen
2. "What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each other?" - T.S. Eliot
3. "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, life might seem like a song where the
lyrics are out of sync, but remember, it's the
harmony we create that matters. Just like a
certain captain finding her way home, your journey
is about making life's trek smoother for others.
They might not always remember your exact words,
but they'll always cherish the warmth of the wings
you help them find, and the enduring light you
ignite in their lives. Keep exploring!

Have a fantastic journey!
