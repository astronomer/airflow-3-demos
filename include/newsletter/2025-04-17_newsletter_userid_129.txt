Hi Jan! 

If you venture outside right now in Bern, you'll find the temperature to be 5.2°C, but it will feel more like 2.3°C. The relative humidity is 89%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Your home is where your thoughts find peace." - Zen Proverb
2. "There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge..." - Napoleon Hill
3. "Being In The Present Means Tuning Out Distractions And Paying Attention To What Is Important, Now." - Spencer Johnson

This is what Jadzia might say to you today:

"Jan, in your quest to find the truth, remember
that your mind is like the Bajoran
Wormhole—boundless and full of potential—but it
needs a clear path, free from distractions, to
navigate effectively. Your peace comes from
focusing on what truly matters now, like Sisko
navigating the complexities of time and space.
Don't limit yourself by doubt; anything is
possible when your thoughts find a peaceful home."

Have a fantastic journey!
