Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Life is like a beautiful melody, only the lyrics are messed up." - Hans Christian Andersen
2. "What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each other?" - T.S. Eliot
3. "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou

Have a fantastic journey!
