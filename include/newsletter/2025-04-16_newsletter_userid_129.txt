Hi Jan! 

If you venture outside right now in Bern, you'll find the temperature to be 8.7°C, but it will feel more like 7.4°C. The relative humidity is 87%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Don't stumble over something that's behind you." - Steve Harvey
2. "Whatever you believe with feeling becomes your reality. " - Brian Tracy
3. "New opinions are always suspected, and usually opposed, without any other reason but because they are not common." - John Locke

This is what Jadzia might say to you today:

Jan, as we navigate the vast sea of life, remember
that the cosmos doesn't chart its course by
looking backward—neither should you. Trust in the
power of your convictions; they will warp time and
space, bending reality to your will. While new
ideas may seem alien and are often resisted, much
like the peace treaty at Khitomer, they hold the
potential for growth unseen. Embrace them as boldy
as if you were confronting a Klingon on neutral
ground, and you'll find your truth.

Have a fantastic journey!
