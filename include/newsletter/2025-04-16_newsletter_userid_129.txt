Hi Jan! 

If you venture outside right now in Bern, you'll find the temperature to be 11.2°C, but it will feel more like 8.7°C. The relative humidity is 83%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education." - Zhuangzi
2. "When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it." - Dalai Lama
3. "When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal; you do not change your decision to get there." - Zig Ziglar


-----------
This is what Jadzia might say to you today:

Jan, remember that true wisdom lies not in seeking
rewards or fearing punishment, but in aligning
with the truth you've always valued. Mistakes will
occur, like the elusive cloaked ship, but the key
is to decloak your resolve and adjust your course
without altering your destination. Just as you
once guided us to 'find the truth,' let it guide
you like a star chart during dark times. Your path
is as resilient as a Trill's symbiote, enduring
and evolving through lifetimes.

Have a fantastic journey!
