Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 17.0°C, but it will feel more like 13.8°C. The relative humidity is 59%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Your home is where your thoughts find peace." - Zen Proverb
2. "There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge..." - Napoleon Hill
3. "Being In The Present Means Tuning Out Distractions And Paying Attention To What Is Important, Now." - Spencer Johnson

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, I've always admired your resolve in
helping others soar. Remember, just as a ship
finds its path even amongst the stars, your home
is where your soul finds balance. Set your
thoughts free; your journey is defined by
boundless potential, not perceived limitations.
Like a Starfleet officer in the midst of an ion
storm, tune into what's truly valuable and
navigate with heart. You've got this, my friend,
just as we once found our way through the Delta
Quadrant.

Have a fantastic journey!
