Hi Richard! 

If you venture outside right now in Los Angeles, you'll find the temperature to be 13.2°C, but it will feel more like 12.1°C. The relative humidity is 75%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time.  " - Zig Ziglar
2. "Troubles are often the tools by which God fashions us for better things." - Henry Ward Beecher
3. "The degree of responsibility you take for your life determines how much change you can create in it." - Celestine Chua

This is what Spock might say to you today:

Richard, remember, even the most complex
calculations yield nothing unless directed with
purpose. Your life's journey may resemble
navigating through a cloud of ionized gas, but
every challenge is a tool refining your character,
much as a Vulcan vitalizes logic through
discipline. The responsibility you wield over your
own trajectory will determine the transformations
you can achieve. Set your phasers to stun the
impossible, and boldly go where only you can. Live
Long and Prosper.

Have a fantastic journey!
