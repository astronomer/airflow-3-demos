This pipelines hows:

- `@asset` syntax
- data-aware scheduling
- event-driven scheduling and inference execution
- dynamic task mapping

## Syntax examples

The [`dags/syntax_examples`](dags/syntax_examples) folder contains simple dags showing Airflow 3.0 features. 

## How to run this demo

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have the [Astro CLI](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/cli/overview) installed and are at least on version 1.34.0. You can upgrade with `brew upgrade astro`.
3. To run the full demo DAGs you will need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), copy the .env_example file to .env and add your OpenAI API key to the file. For the syntax examples you don't need any API keys or connections.
4. Run `astro dev start` to start the local Airflow instance.
5. Enjoy Airflow 3.0!
